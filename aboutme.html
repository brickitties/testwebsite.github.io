				<h1>Who Is Behind BricKitties?</h1>
					<p style="line-height: 1.6;font-size: 20px;">
						Hi! I‚Äôm Sara Sabrina ‚Äî <span class="dbg"><strong>Chief Brickitect</strong></span> and <span class="dbg"><strong>Storyteller</strong></span> behind <em>BricKitties</em>, and proud <span class="dbg"><strong>cat-mum</strong></span>.
						I love creating little worlds full of stories ‚Äî from bustling cat caf√©s to books hiding tiny surprises. My builds almost always include at least one kitty, a playful tribute to my real-life supurrvisors, <span class="darktan"><strong>Lex</strong></span> and <span class="darktan"><strong>Luthor</strong></span>. They‚Äôre my daily inspiration (and occasional source of chaos) as they sneak into my building sessions to rearrange my bricks or demand attention.
					</p>
					<p>
						But there‚Äôs more than just stories hiding in my builds ‚Äî I have a lifelong love of designing interesting patterns, solving puzzles, and finding creative ways to blend playfulness with clever techniques. Whether it‚Äôs sneaking in some math-inspired designs or engineering playful mechanisms, I‚Äôm always looking for ways to turn bricks into something fun and surprising.
					</p>

				<h2>What Might Surprise You About Me?</h2>
					<p>
						People are usually surprised to learn I have a PhD in mathematics ‚Äî though in the LEGO world, that‚Äôs probably not so rare! I actually learned to knit when I was 5 (which, if you think about it, is just LEGO but with yarn) since everyone in my family knits ‚Äî even the male side!
					</p>
					<p>
						Originally, I dreamed of studying astronomy, but I was too scared of studying physics ‚Äî even though I absolutely loved physics back in school. That decision led me to maths, and now, funnily enough, I work in quantum computing ‚Äî which feels just as mind-bending as studying physics, only with a sprinkle of magic on top.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thanks to LEGO Technic, I‚Äôm also discovering a deep love for engineering solutions, and it‚Äôs something I hope my builds can pass on to younger builders ‚Äî especially girls who might not know they have an inner engineer just waiting to be unleashed.

				<h2>In a nutshell (held together with LEGO clips), I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶</h2>
					<p>
						üß© Inventive Builder ‚Äî always experimenting, always learning new things
					</p>
					<p>
						üìñ Story Creator ‚Äî because every build has a story to tell
					</p>
					<p>
						üêæ Feline-Approved Designer-in-Training ‚Äî supervised at every step by Lex and Luthor
					</p>
					<p>
						‚ú® Wannabe Engineer ‚Äî because bricks are just my favourite tools for making things work
					</p>
					<p>
						(This is still a work in progress ‚Äî but right now, I think it best reflects me.)
